# üõ†Ô∏è shelltape

*Tape fixes everything, including your shell.*

Small tools I missed at one point or another. You know that moment when you think "surely there's a command for this..." but there isn't? Yeah, these are those tools.

## Why Ruby?

Because writing shell utilities in Bash is like performing surgery with a butter knife. Ruby is 10x nicer and I'm installing these on my workstations anyway.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shelltape
# Add to your PATH or cry softly
```

Think of it as duct tape for your terminal - quick fixes that actually work.
